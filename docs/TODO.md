# TODO

* Extract functions from game.zig into their own struct
* Rename structs to better match their use cases
* Fix UI based issues on front-end and see if you can merge cleanup branch into main
** Collision issues
** Movements stop after mass multiplayer input
* Finish fully implementing the "Travis Service", subsequently and forever called as such. Rename all references to the the Travis Service
** entity.zig is the crux of this
** The Vroman Compartmentalized Entropy Integration Service
* THEN integrate FSM, export functions, enough to allow for UI based FSM editing
